Downloading and installing
==========================

You can download the latest source files directly from the repository http://bitbucket.org/bolozna/multilayer-networks-library/ as a zip file. Alternatively,
you can use Mercurial to clone the repository:

.. code-block:: none

   $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bolozna/multilayer-networks-library

The current version of the library is written purely in Python, and simply adding the library directory to your Python path is enough to start using it.
